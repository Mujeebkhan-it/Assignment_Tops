    <pre> A website is a collection of related web pages, 
        typically identified by a common domain name, and accessible over the Internet. 
        It can include various types of content like text, images, videos, and interactive elements. 
        Websites can serve many purposes, such as providing information, offering services, selling products, 
        or serving as a platform for communication. They are built using technologies like HTML, CSS, 
        and JavaScript, and are hosted on servers that make them accessible to users via web browsers.

    <marquee><h3><b><i><u>WebPage</u></i></b></h3></marquee>
    <pre>A webpage is a single document on the Internet that is part of a larger website. 
        It is written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and can contain text, images, videos, links, and 
        other multimedia elements. When you navigate to a website, you're viewing one or more webpages. 
        Each webpage is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and can be accessed directly 
        through a web browser. In essence, webpages are the building blocks of websites, 
        with each page serving a specific purpose or function within the site.

    <pre>
        A web browser is a software application used to access and view websites on the Internet. 
        It retrieves, displays, and navigates web pages by interpreting and rendering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from web servers. 
        Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.

Browsers also offer additional features such as bookmarks, tabs for managing multiple pages, 
privacy settings, and extensions or add-ons to enhance functionality. 
They play a crucial role in enabling users to interact with web content and services effectively.

    <marquee><h3><b><i><u>Web server</u></i></b></h3></marquee>
    <pre>
        A web server is a type of software or hardware that stores, processes, and serves web pages to users over the Internet. 
        When a user requests a webpage through their web browser, the web server handles this request by sending the appropriate files and data back to the browser.
        Examples of popular web server software include Apache, Nginx, 
        Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed. 
        These servers can run on various operating systems and can be configured to handle 
        different types of web traffic and applications.

    <marquee><h3><b><i><u>Html</u></i></b></h3></marquee>
    <pre>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. 
        It provides the structure and layout of a webpage by using a system of tags and elements. 
        These tags are used to define and organize content such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, 
        and other elements on a web page.

    <marquee><h3><b><i><u>CSS</u></i></b></h3></marquee>
    <pre>
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout 
        of HTML documents. While HTML structures the content of a webpage, CSS is responsible for 
        its visual appearance, including things like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
