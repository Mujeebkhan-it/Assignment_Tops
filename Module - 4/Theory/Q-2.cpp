//2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts


//		Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," 
//which can contain both data and methods to manipulate that data. 
//OOP aims to increase the modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code by organizing it around objects and their interactions.
//this approach contrasts with procedural programming, which focuses on functions and the sequence of actions to be performed


//Inheritance
//Encapsulation
//Polymorphism
//Abstraction
